This repository contains a set of four R scripts that perform modeling and spatial prediction of soil bacterial alpha diversity based on two widely used indices, Chao1 and Shannon. The scripts include both the model training and evaluation workflow as well as spatial mapping using environmental raster covariates. Specifically, 01_Chao1_Prediction.R and 03_Shannon_Prediction.R train Random Forest models with feature selection based on Forward Recursive Feature Selection (FRFS), generate evaluation statistics, and save trained models for later use. The prediction mapping scripts, 02_Chao1_Mapping.R and 04_Shannon_Mapping.R, apply the trained models to spatial raster datasets to produce tiled predictions and final merged GeoTIFF maps for each index. Together, these scripts provide a reproducible pipeline for soil bacterial diversity modeling and mapping, from machine-learning-based model construction to spatial visualization. All scripts are implemented in R and require packages including ranger, caret, terra, dplyr, and tidyr. This repository is intended to support transparent and repeatable analyses for biodiversity modeling and can be extended to additional indices, environmental datasets, or mapping regions as needed.
